                    <hr class="hr">
                    <p> &ensp; S4 is a game I made in my freshman year at Boise State University for GIMM 110. We were given about a month to create it. A stub was provided
                        with it that gave the basic scripts and objects for making a platformer. I chose to make the game a platformer and a type of shooter. The
                        man character, Sam, was given the legendary shotgun, Shell. You could move, jump, and shoot in the game. I went for something that was 
                        Wario Ware themed, basically playing multiple mini games and it gets harder the longer you last. One minigame was collecting coins on various
                        platform layouts. Another was shooting zombies in an area. Another was traversing through a giant maze to try and find a diamond. It got harder as it
                        progressed, such as having to collect more coins in the coin minigame and having to shoot more zombies in the zombie minigame. 
                        <br><br>
                        &ensp; The entire game was made using Unity and was programmed on Visual Studio using C#. I learned a lot about these things during this project. 
                        I was a little ambitious with the creation of this game and didn't have enough time to do everything I wanted. If you would like to read more about the 
                        process and about the game, see the attached document.

                    <hr class="hr">
                    <p> &ensp; This game made in Unity 3D uses AR features to make a game you play on desktop, created for GIMM 110. The goal was to combine individual games made by 
                        members of GIMM to create a group game that used AR. We used Vuforia to implement marker that could be scanned using a camera. For our game 
                        you plug in an external camera/webcam to scan image targets. The image targets we used initally started out as soda logos but were changed later.
                        In the game, you and another player take turns. One player scans the image trackers to spawn objects into the playing field. They have a certain amount of objects that 
                        they can place, and each time they scan one, it is randomly spawned in locations in the playing field. The other player then plays this platforming creation and tries 
                        to reach a coin that randomly spawns on a platform in the level that was created. You have 3 lives, each fail takes a life and each win gives you a point.
                        <br><br>
                        &ensp; I worked in a group with 2 other members. The 2 other members were super new to programming and to Unity itself. I had to do a lot of the work on this project. All of the code 
                        I created, and it was a lot of lines. I was proud of that aspect. The game came out working perfectly, but it wasn't much of a game. Kind of boring. It was fun to 
                        fully dive into AR for the first time, and definitely stressful as well. We used Unity, coded in C# on Visual Studio, and did AR stuff in Vuforia. If you would like 
                        to read more about the project, please download the analysis below. I also included a zip of the code that I wrote for the project.

                    <p> &ensp; A 2D interactive comic made completely in Unity for GIMM 250. The main character lives in a world without color, and where everything is known. The future for
                        every person is available to be known. An endless cycle of what seems to be a pointless life. The character has a weird encounter with a strange being. This 
                        being reveals itself to be her conciousness, and tries to get her to wake up from this world. The game progress as you make different choices and there are two 
                        different endings. 
                        <br><br>
                        &ensp; This game was made in a group of 4 including myself. These members were fairly new to Unity and to prorgramming itself. This project was interesting because
                        it was very art centered. We had one group member very good at art so we requested he do all the art and not have to worry about the programming, however, I ended up doing 
                        a lot of art for the project. I also did a majority of the programming for this and built a very interesting script for how the story progressed. I was very proud of it. If you 
                        would like to see some of the art pieces I did on the project or learn more about the project, please see the links below. I have also included a link to some of the code I wrote.
                        The most impressive is the "JCTextbox" script.

                      it let me do a lot of practice in Unity with C# and drawing sprites in Aseprite. I also made some music and sound effects on my own. It was a fun little thing

                    <p> &ensp; The opening animation for my D&D Campaign, The Sands of Time made for GIMM 200. The animation is around 50 seconds long and shows off the main characters
                      of the campaign and also the main villian. The campaign picks up right after the actions of this animation. 
                      <br><br>
                      &ensp; We were given completely freedom on this animation and I had a ton of fun with it. I thought that what better animation to make than the opening for my D&D 
                      campaign so my campaign could really stand out from my other friends. I made the project completely by myself. All art was done in Adobe Photoshop, including making frames
                      for animations such as the smoke explosion when the villian lands in the desert. Everything was then done frame-by-frame in Adobe Animate. Sound effects and music was later
                      added in Adobe Premiere Pro. Seeing animations come together after all my work is one of my favroite things and this was no exception. If you would like to read more, I have

                      Unity VR, however, whenever something has to interact with the player, it becomes more complicated. I would say this project has been a great
